Standard state-space:
x(t+1) = A x(t) + B u(t)
y(t) = C x(t) + D u(t)

I/O Subspace method
Y = OX + HU
- U, Y... block Hankel ??
- O observability... H based on sys matrixs
- X is the sequence of states
- The method uses SVD on projected output matrix and computes system realization... but loses Hankel structure???

Alternative: nuclear norm
- convex huristic
min \norm{YQ}_* + \rho \sum_t \nomr{y(t) - y_m(t)}_2^2
- Q is bases of U nullspace
- \rho > 0
- Y is hankel constructed from y(t) outputs
- Then uses SDP to solve

Graphical models:
-stats things... but issues with topology ?
- use 1-norm penalty:
minimize \trace{CX} − \log \det{X} + \rho \norm{X}_1
- X is invers cov matrix (\Sigma^-1)
- C is sample covairance matrix

- Topology based on sparcity pattern of S(\omega)
S(\omega) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty R_k e^{jk\omega}
with R_k = E[ x(t+k) x(t)^T]

Autoregresive models:??
x(t) = - \sum_{k=1}^p A_k x(t-k) + v(t), v(t) ~ \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)

leads to:
minimize \trace{CX} − \log \det{X_{00}} + \rho h(x)
subject to X \succeq 0

X is (p+1)x(p+1) block matrix of blocks (nxn)
X_{00} leading block of X\
h(X) choosen to encourage a common, symmetric sparsity pattern for the
diagonal sums....


Then... Algorithms for other problems...



**Jonas** 4.1: Interior point algorithms

- I think it is similar to the process of restructuring a problem in epigraph form (or similar substitution)
- 1- and nuclear-norm are given as examples, but references a chapter from a book with a lot of examples
(if we want more about this the book is a good reference... have it saved)
- nuclear-norm example paper walks through interior-point implimentation specific to the nuclear-norm in two methods... not sure how useful it would be to explain in-depth (especially the complicated one)
- These algorithms are all built around the idea of using the structure of a problem and essentially only solving with the non-zero parts of it... and is really about computational efficiency

- The paper walks through the exact formulation of the problem and demonstrates experimental results

- The methods outlined simply in the paper is a main resutl
See the papers for the equations... and proof... a bit too detailed for a presentation
