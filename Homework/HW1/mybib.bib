	abstract = "The vision of secure cyber-physical systems requires to develop a new array of tools to prevent, monitor for, and recover from a wide variety of potential attacks to a system. We contribute to this vision here by addressing the problem of optimal sensor design for detection of injection attacks. More precisely, we consider an attack in which a sensor output is corrupted, and we have at our disposal a sensor deployed in an ad-hoc fashion and thus is secure. How to design the sensor so that we maximize the probability of detection of such an injection attack? We pose the problem here as an hypothesis test, describe an optimization problem that the optimal sensor needs to satisfy, and furthermore obtain the analytic solution in a particular case."
